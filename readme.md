# Overview

Hydra is a code generator project in the spirit of Yeoman, but not as heavy handed as Maven Archetypes, but
written in Java, and with possibly a more arcane name.

The idea is that given some kind of seed structure and a bit of custom code this tool would be how future
project setup would be done.  No requirement exists to include scaffolding for things like sub-views
or plug-in(s) to existing project structures -- but we'll see how that goes.  Providing a examples and
guidelines for testing project generation are higher on the list.


## Target Process

- Use a generator-generator to start a new generator
- Withing that generator take advantage of core models and utilities to facilitate a new project template.
- Store templates in a local repo and generate templates for a variety of uses.


## Setup

At the moment the project is very young and is maintained as a working project here just for backup, and
to entertain anyone who is interested.  As of 5-19-2014 there is not a working example, but check back
in a few weeks if this is something you are interested in contributing to.
